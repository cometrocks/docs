## 1. Creating a cart

Everything starts with the cart creation. The `cartCreate` mutation returns a `Cart` type ([definition here](https://gitlab.com/comet-rocks/backend-core/-/blob/main/apps/api/checkout/src/cart/cart.graphql#L1))

```graphql
mutation CartCreate {
  cartCreate {
    id
  }
}
```

This mutation does not require any variables as input. 

⚠️ For now, save the cart id locally to interact with the cart, in the near future we may add a cart connection to the `me` query
