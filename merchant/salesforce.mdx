# Comet-SFCC Integration Guide

# Overview

The Comet cartridge is designed to streamline the process of retrieving data (Product, price books and inventory) from the Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC) system in XML format. The cartridge uses out of the box export jobs which efficiently transfers the retrieved data to the Comet WEBDAV location by leveraging SFCC custom jobs, ensuring a smooth and automated data flow.

# Supported Versions (Cartridge Compatibility)

The Comet cartridge is versatile and compatible with both SFRA and SiteGenesis shops. It has been thoroughly tested with SFRA 7.0 (SFCC 24.3) and offers support for versions as early as 6.3 (Compatibility mode of SFCC 22.7). This wide range of compatibility ensures that the cartridge can be seamlessly integrated into various SFCC environments.

# Integration Video

We take pride in the exceptionally seamless integration process with Comet. Our team has worked diligently to ensure that the integration is not only swift but also incredibly straightforward. To showcase the ease of integration, we have prepared a video demonstration using SFRA. This video provides a clear visual representation of how effortlessly the Comet cartridge can be integrated into your SFCC system.

## Integration Steps

### Adding the cartridge into the workspace
To upload the cartridges into the SFCC server, you first need to add the cartridges in your IDE (Code workspace).
#### Step 1: Set up the cartridge path
Before the Comet functionality can become available, the cartridge needs to be added to the cartridge path of the BM. In order to do this, follow the following instructions:
    1. 	Log into Business Manager.
    2. 	Navigate to Administration > Sites > Manage Sites.
    3. 	Go to 'Manage the Business Manager site'.

Job Cartridge: bc_comet (To export catalog and order)
    1.  In the Cartridges input field add ‘bc_comet’.
    2.  Click on the 'Apply' button.

Storefront cartridge:
    1. Navigate to Administration > Sites > Manage Sites.
    2. Select you site (ex: Administration >  Sites >  Manage Sites > [Your Site ID] – Settings
    3. Add the cartridge name ‘int_comet_core’ in the front of the path.


#### Step 2: Importing Metadata

To enable the Comet integration, the following object structures (metadata) must be imported and configured in the Business Manager:

> **Important**: If Adyen is already integrated in the SFCC site, then please skip the Adyen-specific metadata included in the provided metadata.

1. Locate the `metadata/comet-meta-import` folder within the cartridge bundle.
2. Inside the `metadata` folder, compress the `comet-meta-import` folder to generate a `comet-meta-import.zip` file.
3. Navigate to **Business Manager Menu** > **Administration** > **Site Development** > **Site Import & Export**.
4. Under the **Import: Upload Archive** section, ensure that the radio button labeled "Local" is enabled. If not, click on the radio button to enable it.
5. Click on the **Choose File** input field and select the `comet-meta-import.zip` file from the open dialog box.
6. Click on the **Upload** button to initiate the upload process.
7. Once the upload is complete, locate the `comet-meta-import.zip` file in the **Archives** list.
8. Click on the radio button corresponding to `comet-meta-import.zip` and then click on the **Import** button.
9. A confirmation box will appear, asking, "Are you sure that you want to import the selected archive?" Click on the **OK** button to proceed.
10. Please provide the Comet WebDAV server credentials and OCAPI `client_id`.

> **Note**: Currently, Comet utilizes OCAPI and SCAPI endpoints in the checkout flow. However, we plan to switch to completly SCAPI in our next release.

**Used OCAPI endpoints**

  | Jobs API |read_attributes, write_attributes |  POST   /jobs/\*/executions | Execute the jobs |
  | |read_attributes, write_attributes | POST /job_execution_search | Search job    |


#### Step 3: Update custom preference
In Business Manager, navigate to Merchant ToolsSite > Preferences Custom > Site Preference Groups. Custom preference groups with the ID “Comet Configuration” are available.
![comet-custom-preference.png](/images/salesforce/comet-custom-preference.png)

  |Comet Attributes|Purpose|
  |----|----|
  |Comet WebDAV URL|The Comet WebDAV URL is the endpoint provided by the Comet system for accessing and dropping files using the WebDAV protocol. The URL can be obtained on [this step](/merchant/salesforce#4-add-these-credentials-to-business-manager)|
  |Comet App Client id|The Comet App Client ID is a unique identifier assigned to the client application that is authorized to access the Comet system. This will be generated on [this step](/merchant/salesforce#4-add-these-credentials-to-business-manager)|
  |Comet App client password|The Comet App Client Password is the corresponding password associated with the Comet App Client ID. This will be generated on [this step](/merchant/salesforce#4-add-these-credentials-to-business-manager)|
  |Comet Brand Organization ID|The Comet Brand Organization ID represents the specific organization or brand within the Comet system that the integration is associated with. The ID can be obtained on [this step](/merchant/salesforce#4-add-these-credentials-to-business-manager)|
  |Comet Parent Store Environment Id|The Comet Parent Store Environment ID identifies the specific environment within the Salesforce Commerce Cloud where the integration is being set up. It helps in distinguishing between different environments, such as development, staging, or production OR Site A, Site B ..etc, and ensures that the integration is configured correctly for the intended environment.The ID can be obtained on [this step](/merchant/salesforce#4-add-these-credentials-to-business-manager)|
  |Start Order Number for Job|The Start Order Number for Job field is used to specify the order number from which the order export process should begin. This field is particularly useful in two scenarios: 1. When exporting orders for the first time, you can set the starting order number to ensure that all relevant orders are included in the export. 2. If a previous job fails, you can use this field to resume the export process from a specific order number, avoiding the need to start from the beginning.|
  |Order Export Start Time (in minute)|The Order Export Start Time field allows you to specify the time, in minutes, from when the orders should be exported. This field is optional and provides an alternative way to determine the starting point for order export. It is useful in scenarios where you want to export orders based on a specific time frame rather than an order number. For example: - If you enter 1440 minutes, the system will export orders from one day before the current time. - If you enter 10080 minutes, the system will export orders from 7 days before the current time. Note: Either the Start Order Number or the Order Export Start Time should be provided to determine the starting point for order export.|
  

#### Step 4: Configure the jobs
- Please follow the [instructions](/merchant/salesforce#1-comet-all-full-export-job) and configure the jobs.
- Delta jobs: The Comet cartridge utilizes SFCC's default delta jobs. Ensure that the delta job feature is activated in the sandbox or instance where it is being employed. If not enabled, please reach out to SFCC support. If you are able to see this "Delta Exports" options at Administration >  Site Development >  Delta Exports, then its already enabled. Then, follow the [instructions](/merchant/salesforce#2-delta-price-books-export-job)

> **Note**: The integration has been completed.

## Integration Jobs Overview

The integration cartridge mostly uses SFCC's out of the box jobs to export full and delta data. Comet requires the following SFCC catalog data for integration:

- Base catalog
- Storefront catalog
- Inventory data
- Pricebook data

Navigate to Administration > Operations > Jobs, after successful metadata import a list of jobs with ‘Comet’ as prefix can be seen.
The Comet cartridge provides two types of jobs to export SFCC catalog data and send it to the Comet WebDAV. Merchants can choose the job type that best suits their requirements and integration preferences.

**Single Job**

Alternatively, merchants can opt for a single job that encompasses all the necessary data exports. This job can be scheduled and executed as a single entity, simplifying the process for merchants who prefer a more streamlined approach.


 **Multiple Jobs**

In this approach, separate jobs are available for each component:

- Base catalog job
- Storefront catalog job
- Inventory data job
- Pricebook data job

Each job can be scheduled and executed independently, allowing for more granular control over the data export process.

To test the functionality of the cartridge, follow these steps:

1. Run any of the Comet Jobs.
2. Wait for the Job execution to complete.
3. Check the Job status:
   - If the Job ends with status "OK":
