This guide is intended for Shopify merchants who are connecting their store to Comet through a Shopify Custom App. During this process, the merchant will create a Custom App in their Shopify dashboard and then provide the generated credentials to Comet Rocks through the dashboard. The merchant will retain full control of the created Custom App and can modify or remove it at any time from within their Shopify dashboard. Total time for completion is around 3 minutes.
