There are two distinct methods for installing our Magento 2 extension: one involves utilizing Composer (primarily suitable for those who have procured it via the Magento Marketplace), while the alternative entails a manual process wherein you copy the essential files directly onto your server.

### Step 1: Update the Magento composer.json file

  1. Log in to your Magento server as the file system owner and navigate to the Magento root folder to install the module via Composer.
  
  2. Update the composer.json file from the command line interface (CLI) using:
  
  `composer require cometrocks/integration`

### Step 2: Register the Extension and Clear Magento Cache/Deploy static content files/compile PHP files.


Run the following commands to register the Magento 2 extension, compile code, and deploy static view files:

    1. php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    2. php bin/magento setup:di:compile
    3. php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy (if your Magento is in development mode - you might want to run: "php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f" instead (without quotes))
    4. php bin/magento cache:flush

Please, note: On some servers, you will need to launch these commands without "php" at the beginning (like this: bin/magento setup:upgrade) and on some servers that have multiple PHP versions installed you might need to specify php version depending on your Magento version PHP requirements.
Example: /usr/bin/php7.4 bin/magento setup:upgrade


### Step 3: API keys.

Log in to your Magento Admin panel and navigate to Stores - Configuration - COMETROCKS - Integration. From here simply press the "Generate" button to Generate API keys.
