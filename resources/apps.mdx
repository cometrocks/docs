## Overview

Apps in Comet provide a seamless way to access the vast product catalog and utilize the robust checkout process. By integrating with Comet's GraphQL API, you can offer your customers a wide range of products without the overhead of managing inventory or handling the checkout process.

## Creating an App

1. **Sign Up**: Begin by creating your account on [Comet Console](https://console.comet.rocks/).

2. **Dashboard Navigation**: Once logged in, navigate to the 'Apps' section in the dashboard.

3. **Create New App**: Click on the 'Create New App' button. Provide a name for your app and describe its purpose. This will help you identify the app later, especially if you have multiple integrations.

4. **API Key Generation**: After creating the app, Comet will automatically generate an API key for you. This API key is essential for integrating your application with Comet's GraphQL API.

5. **Manage App**: You can always return to the dashboard to manage your app, regenerate the API key if needed, or delete the app.

## Integration

With the API key in hand, you can now integrate your application with Comet:

1. **Authentication**: Use the API key for authentication when making requests to Comet's GraphQL API. This ensures that your requests are secure and associated with your app.

2. **Fetch Products**: Access Cometâ€™s vast product catalog and display them to your customers.

3. **Checkout Process**: Complete the checkout with multiple brands using single cart and single checkout process.
