### Apply Shipping Address

After setting the shipping address, the function provides an updated [Cart](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Cart) as the result.

```graphql
mutation ApplyShippingAddress($id: ID!, $input: CartApplyShippingAddressInput!) {
  cartApplyShippingAddress(id: $id, input: $input) {
    id
    # Other fields of the Cart type can be queried here
  }
}
```

```
{
  "id": "cart_ZMe6Bb4GqqUe3BWV",
