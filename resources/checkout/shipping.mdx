### Getting Shipping Methods from Cart

You can use the [cart](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Query#cart) query to retrieve details about a specific cart, including available shipping methods for each bag in the cart.

```graphql
query RetrieveCart($id: ID!) {
  cart(id: $id) {
    id
    bags {
      id
      availableShippingMethods {
        id
        name
        description
        price {
          amount
          currency
        }
      }
    }
    # Other fields of the Cart type can be queried here
  }
}
```
#### Input Parameters for `cart`

- `id`: The ID of the cart you want to retrieve.

**Example**:
```json
    {
        "id": "cart_ZMe6Bb4GqqUe3BWV"
    }
```

### `cartApplyShippingMethods`

After applying the shipping methods, the function provides an updated [Cart](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Cart) as the result.

```graphql
mutation ApplyShippingMethods($id: ID!, $input: CartApplyShippingMethodsInput!) {
  cartApplyShippingMethods(id: $id, input: $input) {
    id
    bags {
      id

        price {
          amount
          currency
        }
      }
    }
    # Other fields of the Cart type can be queried here
  }
}
```
