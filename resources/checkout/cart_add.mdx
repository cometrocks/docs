## Adding products to your cart

You can use the [cartAddProducts](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Mutation#cartAddProducts) function to add products to your cart. This function takes the products you want to add and includes them in your cart.

After adding products, the function provides an updated cart [Cart](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Cart) as the result.

Here is an example of how you can use the mutation to add products to your cart:

```graphql
mutation CartAddProducts($cartId: ID!, $input: CartAddProductsInput!) {
  cartAddProducts(id: $cartId, input: $input) {
    id
    # Check the Cart type for its fields
  }
}
```

The quantity field indicates the number of products you want to add to the cart. For instance, let's say your cart already has 1 unit of the product with ID `prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKEz`. The following JSON code will add 2 more units of that product, resulting in a total of 3 units:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "cartId": "cart_ZMe6Bb4GqqUe3BWV",
    "products": [
      {
        "productId": "prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKEz",
        "quantity": 2
      },
      {
        "productId": "prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKE0",
        "quantity": 3
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Removing products from cart

To remove products from your cart, you can use the [cartRemoveProducts](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Mutation#cartRemoveProducts) mutation. This mutation lets you specify the products you want to remove from the cart.

After removing the products, the function returns an updated cart [Cart](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Cart).

Here is an example of how you can use the mutation to remove products from your cart:

```graphql
mutation CartRemoveProducts($cartId: ID!, $input: CartRemoveProductsInput!) {
  cartRemoveProducts(id: $cartId, input: $input) {
    id
    # Check the Cart type for its fields
  }
}
```

The quantity field indicates the number of products you want to remove from the cart. For instance, if your cart contains 2 units of the product with ID `prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKEz` and 3 units of the product with ID `prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKE0`, the following JSON code will remove 1 unit of the first product and 2 units of the second product:

```json
{
  "input": {
    "cartId": "cart_ZMe6Bb4GqqUe3BWV",
    "products": [
      {
        "productId": "prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKEz",
        "quantity": 1
      },
      {
        "productId": "prd_ZJQYAR_-ypwOLKE0",
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
