In the Comet API, you can fetch detailed information about a specific product using its unique identifier. This is particularly useful when you need in-depth details about a single product rather than a list.

### Query

To retrieve a product by its ID, use the `product` query:

```graphql
query GetProductByID($productID: ID!) {
  product(id: $productID) {
    id
    sku
    name
    description
    organizationId
    shopSystemEnvironmentId
    externalId
    type
    variantOf {
      id
      name
    }
    # ...
  }
}
```

Replace `$productID` with the ID of the product you wish to retrieve.

### Product Details

The `product` query returns a comprehensive set of details about the product:

- **Basic Information**: This includes the product's ID, SKU, name, and description.
- **Organization and Shop System**: Details about the organization and shop system associated with the product.
- **Variants and Attributes**: Information about the product's variants and their attributes.
- **Pricing**: The prices associated with the product.
- **Images**: Both original and public images of the product.
- **Tags and Metadata**: Any tags associated with the product and additional metadata.

For a more detailed breakdown of the `Product` type and its associated fields, refer to the [Product](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Product).
