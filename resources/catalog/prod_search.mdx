In the Comet API, the `productFind` query provides a powerful way to search for products based on specific criteria. Whether you're looking for products of a certain type, within a price range, or with a specific name, this query has you covered.

### Query

To search for products, use the `productFind` query:


```graphql
query SearchProducts($organizationId: ID!, $filters: ProductFindFilters, $pagination: Pagination) {
  productFind(organizationId: $organizationId, filters: $filters, pagination: $pagination) {
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      totalCount
    }
    nodes {
      id
      name
      type
      # Other product fields as needed
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `$organizationId`, `$filters`, and `$pagination` with the appropriate values for your search.

### Parameters

- **organizationId**: The unique identifier for any brand or publisher in the system. This helps in narrowing down the search to products associated with a specific organization.

### Filters

The `productFind` query supports a variety of filters to refine your search:

- **shopSystemEnvironmentId**: Filter products based on the shop system environment.
- **name**: Search for products with a specific name or name pattern.
- **type**: Filter products based on their type.
- **variantOf**: Search for products that are variants of a specific product.
- **priceMin**: Set a minimum price for the products in your search.
- **priceMax**: Set a maximum price for the products in your search.

### Pagination

To retrieve products in manageable chunks, use the pagination parameters:

- **first**: The number of records to retrieve after the specified cursor.
- **after**: The cursor to start retrieving records after.
- **last**: The number of records to retrieve before the specified cursor.
- **before**: The cursor to start retrieving records before.

If pagination is not provided, the default page size is 10 records. For more details on pagination, refer to the [Pagination Documentation](#).

### Product Results

The `productFind` query returns a `ProductConnection` type, which includes:

- **pageInfo**: Information about the current page of results, including cursors, page indicators, and total count.
- **nodes**: A list of products that match the search criteria.

For a more detailed breakdown of the `Product` type and its associated fields, refer to the [Product Schema Documentation](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/CometAPI/variant/main/schema/reference/objects/Product).
